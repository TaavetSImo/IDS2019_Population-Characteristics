# IDS2019_The Effect of Population and Economic Characteristics on CO2 Emissions

The Project was originally called Population Characteristics, however when working with the
data it became clear that the goals deffined for that project were too vague and we were
not able to collect the needed data in the allowed timeframe so we changed the aim of 
the project to something more relevant.

The IDS_PROJECT_NOTEBOOK.ipynb contains the main code of the project
DS_Final notebook contains the final draft for information that was added to the psoter
IDS_PROJECT_DATA contains all the files used in IDS_PROJECT_NOTEBOOK.
DATA_MISC contains CSV files that were made during the project.
